# Clicker Heroes 2 Skill Tree Planner: updates

All substantial Skill Tree Planner changes.

## [Unreleased]
### Beta/experimental features
These are at least partially working, but turned off by default.

- [Select/unselect multiple nodes with one click](https://ch2.erosson.org/?enableMultiSelect=1). This is still very slow: https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/issues/2
- [Zoom/pan](https://ch2.erosson.org/?enableZoom=1). [Thanks, @Judgy53](https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/pull/15)! https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/issues/4

- Improvements to zooming/panning - [thanks, @Judgy53](https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/pull/18)!
- Performance tweaking - selecting/unselecting nodes should be a bit faster.
- Nicer background images for small nodes, next (purple) nodes, and search results nodes.
- Improved visibility for some nodes - small nodes now have a green border when selected; search results now have a bright red border.

## 2018-07-20
- New beta feature: zoom/pan.
- New beta feature: select/unselect multiple nodes with one click. Thanks, [@Judgy53](https://github.com/Judgy53)!
- Redesigned how data's extracted from the Clicker Heroes 2 game files. Tooltips should be more complete, and future updates to game data are more automatic.
- Added support for multiple character classes. Added a link to the (currently empty) wizard.
- Icons now have transparency, and icon backgrounds now use the fancy in-game galaxy(?) images. Search results should be much more visible.
- Started this changelog. (Shame on me for not having one from the start; things were a bit rushed.)
