# Clicker Heroes 2 Skill Tree Planner: updates

All substantial Skill Tree Planner changes.

## [Unreleased]
### Beta/experimental features
These are at least partially working, but turned off by default.

- [Select/unselect multiple nodes with one click](https://ch2.erosson.org/?enableMultiSelect=1). This is still very slow: https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/issues/2
- [Zoom/pan](https://ch2.erosson.org/?enableZoom=1). [Thanks, @Judgy53](https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/pull/15)! https://github.com/erosson/ch2plan/issues/4
